          Through the user research it is clear that a content based solution provides the most effective way to reach our goals of raising awareness of NFM.

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Option A still explores the use of a location service to provide local context, but the 'story' is made a bit tighter. Also the content pages are pared back so they are more different top Option B. This makes sure that there is a clear distinction between the layouts for the user.

          <a href="v1-1/v1-b/start">Option B</a>
        </h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Option B remains largely the same, but we have rearranged the order of the sections to see if making the NFM section more prevalent has any effect. There are also some extra navgation cues at the bottom of sections to aid the journey through the story steps.
