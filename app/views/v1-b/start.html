      What is Natural Flood Management?
    </h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Sometime known as working with natural processes, or  nature based solutions, natural flood management (NFM) is when natural processes are used to reduce the risk of flooding and coastal erosion. Examples include: restoring bends in rivers, changing the way land is managed so soil can absorb more water and creating saltmarshes on the coast to absorb wave energy.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      There are different types of NFM for differnt ladscapes. From farmers fields, to valleys, to urban housing estates, there is a form of NFM that can be used to help ruduce flood risks.
