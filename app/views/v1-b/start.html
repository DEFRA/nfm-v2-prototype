      What is Natural Flood Management?
    </h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Leaky barriers constructed in streams and ditches are designed to hold back flood water within the channel or encourage water to spill onto the banks, reducing the downstream flood peak by temporarily storing water and slowing the flow.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Leaky barriers are designed to replicate naturally fallen trees and create a variety of habitats and flow conditions. They are set above normal stream level, so normal flows and fish movement are not impeded. When whole trunks are used, secured into place, they are referred to as large woody dams.
