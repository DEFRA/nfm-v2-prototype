        Reducing flooding by using Natural Flood Management
      </a>
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      There are many ways to reduce flood risk to an area. The first things people think of are often large scale, hard engineered flood walls or other river mangement schemes. These can be very effective in the right areas but they are hugely expensive, disruptive and can be environmentally damaging.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        Large scale soultions aren't suitable for every area. Even if they are in place they may not be effective used on their own, especially as we see more rain every year. There are other, smaller scale, measures that can help.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      What is Natural Flood Management?
    </h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Sometime known as working with natural processes, or  nature based solutions, natural flood management (NFM) is when natural processes are used to reduce the risk of flooding and coastal erosion. Examples include: restoring bends in rivers, changing the way land is managed so soil can absorb more water and creating saltmarshes on the coast to absorb wave energy.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      There are different types of NFM for differnt ladscapes. From farmers fields, to valleys, to urban housing estates, there is a form of NFM that can be used to help ruduce flood risks.
