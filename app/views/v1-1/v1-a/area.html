      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to help reduce flood risk</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        There are many ways to reduce flood risk to an area. The first things people think of are often large scale, hard engineered flood walls and other river mangement schemes. These can be very effective in the right areas, but they are hugely expensive, disruptive and environmentally damaging.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
          Large scale, engineered soultions aren't suitable for every area. Even if they are in place, they may not be effective used on their own, especially as we see more rain every year. There are other, smaller scale measure that can help.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Natural Flood Management</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Natural Flood Management (NFM), sometimes known as Working with Natural Processes or Nature Based Soultions, is a number of smaller scale techniques that enhance the effectiveness of traditional flood defence mechanisms. Their aim is to catch and slow water as it flows so that it doesn't all meet at the same time during floods.
