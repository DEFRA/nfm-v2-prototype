        Leaky Barriers
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Leaky barriers constructed in streams and ditches are designed to hold back flood water within the channel or encourage water to spill onto the banks, reducing the downstream flood peak by temporarily storing water and slowing the flow.
      </p>

      <img class="content-image" src="/public/images/Pickering_LeakyDam.jpg" alt="A photograph of a leaky dam project in Pickering">

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Leaky barriers are designed to replicate naturally fallen trees and create a variety of habitats and flow conditions. They are set above normal stream level, so normal flows and fish movement are not impeded. When whole trunks are used, secured into place, they are referred to as large woody dams.

        Water Butts
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        If installing water butts can save 30,000 million litres of water each summer that means that 30,000 million litres of water could be saved from rushing to the drains when it is raining. This reduces the volume of water in our surface water sewer system and could alleviate areas at risk of surface water flooding.

      <p class="govuk-body">
        And that is why I am often singing the praises of the humble water butt. Water butts are one of the many features that can help prevent our drains from becoming overwhelmed during heavy rainfall, and theyâ€™re possibly the easiest SuDS measure to install at home. So why not get one yourself?
